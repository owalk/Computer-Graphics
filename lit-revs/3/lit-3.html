<p>Third lit review</p>
<p>Oliver Walker</p>
<p>For the third literature review I decided to read the article Playing to learn game design skills through the context of a game, from the AMC digital library. This short article presents early research findings from a simulation game called Gamestar Mechanic. As the article states, “Gamestar Mechanic is a game designed to teach young people about game design, with the emphasis on design, not programming. Game design inherently involves building, assessing, and transforming systems that involve game mechanics and human interactions with technology and other humans”. The audience of the study was middle and high school students with no prior knowledge of game design. </p>
<p>One of the more interesting concepts described in this article was the section titled learners as producers of knowledge. The concept in a nutshell is that learners are provided the tools to learn, a community to learn with, and the freedom to apply as much creativity as possible to their learning environment. A section that caught my eye in this part of the article was the when the article said “modding at the highest levels— though not in its more modest forms—is very probably strongly associated with a relatively small set of privileged young people, often males. Gamestar Mechanic is meant to spread the modding attitude and its attendant skills and values. It is meant to lead to young people transferring the modding attitude to other technologies and settings.” What I interpreted this to mean is that the game used in the study was teaching values as well as the mechanics behind game design and I just found that interesting to think about. It really prepares you for a possible career in the field when you learn in that manner.</p>
<p>The second article I read that was cited by the first went by the title The Process of Learning in a Simulation Strategy Game: Disciplinary Knowledge Construction. This article presented itself as a very large wall of text and was far less interesting to me. it touched upon many different topics including motivational valuing, and gaming navigational strategies: elucidating the learning process through player style. </p>
<p>The second topic, gaming navigational strategies: elucidating the learning process through player style was mostly about studies done on MMO players and what strategies those players used and how that correlated to the process of learning based on player strategy tendencies. The researcher categorized the strategies into the main groups: goal seekers and explorers. Each of those groups had sub groups attached to them. Explorers had comprehensive explorers and localized explorers while goal seekers had the subcategories of beating the game or beating other players. Just from my personal experience I can relate to how those 4 different mindsets can drastically alter the gamers experience of the game.</p>
<p>The two articles relate to one another in that the first most likely used the conclusions of the second in designing their experiment. The conclusions of the second article directly relate to the research done in the first so it would make sense that the second article’s conclusions are the foundation of the first articles research.</p>

    abstract = { Researchers question how and what students learn from commercial digital games. Using a concurrent mixed-methods approach, this study examined 30 students' construction of knowledge and skills while playing a commercial off-the-shelf game for 7 weeks. Quantitative data included students' background survey and pre- and post-assessments for knowledge and motivation. Qualitative data included students log sheets to document their progress of play through the game, videotaped interviews after each playing session as well as videotaped game sessions. Analysis indicates that two main play strategies were used during the process of learning—explorers or goal seekers. Both player types were able to statistically significantly gain disciplinary knowledge and skills, but only explorers significantly valued the learning. }
