Week 1 report:

this week I found an example of a square on three.js and i used the code to build off of that example and then changed it
so that it would fit into my project in the way that I want it to.

I altered several aspects of the code and played with it changing different parts to fully understand how it works

next week i plan to use this code to add in a bunch of custom built functionality that will make this code my own.

Week 2 report:

This week i've planned out a bit more of the project and i have spent some time looking up how to do cool stuff in javascript.

I also made the manual an imported html file through jquery. i plan on using this technique for a few more cool aspects to this project.

I played around with the css a lot and I started the code for adding in all the sliders that manipulate the cube properties.
