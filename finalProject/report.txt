Week 1 report:

this week I found an example of a square on three.js and i used the code to build off of that example and then changed it
so that it would fit into my project in the way that I want it to.

I altered several aspects of the code and played with it changing different parts to fully understand how it works

next week i plan to use this code to add in a bunch of custom built functionality that will make this code my own.

Week 2 report:

This week i've planned out a bit more of the project and i have spent some time looking up how to do cool stuff in javascript.

I also made the manual an imported html file through jquery. i plan on using this technique for a few more cool aspects to this project.

I played around with the css a lot and I started the code for adding in all the sliders that manipulate the cube properties.

Week 3 report:

this week I tweaked some more settings and got ready for more camera control settings. Tomorrow I will finish implementing all the camera contral stuff
and finish the slider that controls how many triangles make up the cube. currently when the setting is changed, the already loaded triangles stay catched
and i have a hard time making them dissapear.
